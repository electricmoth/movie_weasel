# Movie Weasel - Movie Database Application

Movie Weasel is a privacy-respecting Python application for managing a movie database with a graphical user interface (GUI).
Users can add, view, and search for movies in the database, along with additional details like director, rating, and comments.
The database is stored locally and no data whatsoever is transmitted.

This project is a work in progress and currently lacking edit/delete features for the database.
It is also a project for school.
